## Q1

(1)

* Yes,it is.

* because use the banker's algorithm, we'll find out that the it can support the max need of the processes.

(2)

(3)

* P1: yes, because the required resource A and B is not enough.

* P2: yes, beacuse the required resource is not enough.

* P3: no.

* P4: yes, because the required resource is not enough.

## Q2

* design ideas1: before eating, they should check whether the fork_left and right is available, if available, eating, else put down the fork in  hand and go sleeping.

* code1:

```code
int fork_see[5];
void init() {
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
    {
        fork_see[i]=0;
    }
}

void wants_to_eat(int p_no) {
    // fixme
    
    pick_right_fork(p_no);
    __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[right_fork_no(p_no)], 1);
    while(fork_see[p_no]>0)
    {
        put_right_fork(p_no);
        __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[right_fork_no(p_no)], -1);
        __sync_fetch_and_add(&pick_cnt, -1);
        usleep(1000);
        pick_right_fork(p_no);
        __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[right_fork_no(p_no)], 1);
    }
    pick_left_fork(p_no);
    __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[p_no], 1);
    eat(p_no);

    put_left_fork(p_no);
    __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[p_no], -1);
    put_right_fork(p_no);
    __sync_fetch_and_add(&fork_see[right_fork_no(p_no)], -1);
}

```

* result1:

```result1
11911609JohnnyGe@johnny-Ge-WXX9:~/OS/assignments/week12$ gcc phy1.c -pthread
11911609JohnnyGe@johnny-Ge-WXX9:~/OS/assignments/week12$ ./a.out 
[----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------] 100% done ok.
```

* design idea2: only one person can eat, the others wait until he finished.

* code2:

```code2
pthread_mutex_t lock;
void init()
{
    
}

void wants_to_eat(int p_no)
{
    // fixme
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    
    pick_right_fork(p_no);
    pick_left_fork(p_no);

    eat(p_no);

    put_left_fork(p_no);
    put_right_fork(p_no);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
}

```

* result2:

```result2
11911609JohnnyGe@johnny-Ge-WXX9:~/OS/assignments/week12$ gcc phy2.c -pthread
11911609JohnnyGe@johnny-Ge-WXX9:~/OS/assignments/week12$ ./a.out 
[----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------] 100% done ok.
```

## Q3

* design idea: use semaphore sonlock to control the son, use semaphore parentlock to control the parent.

* code:

```code3
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h> 
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>


pthread_mutex_t fri_lock;
sem_t sonlock;
sem_t parent_lock;
void *mom(int *num){
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
        sem_wait(&parent_lock);
        // pthread_mutex_lock(&fri_lock);
        printf("Mom comes home.\n");
        sleep(rand()%2+1);
        printf("Mom goes to buy milk.\n");
        *num += 1;
        if (*num > 2){
            printf("What a waste of food! The fridge can not hold so much milk!\n");
            while(1)printf("TAT~");
        }
        printf("Mom puts milk in fridge and leaves.\n");
        // pthread_mutex_unlock(&fri_lock);
        sem_post(&sonlock);
    }
    
}

void *dad(int *num){
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
        sem_wait(&parent_lock);
        // pthread_mutex_lock(&fri_lock);
        printf("Dad comes home.\n");
        sleep(rand()%2+1);
        printf("Dad goes to buy milk.\n");
        *num += 1;
        if (*num > 2){
            printf("What a waste of food! The fridge can not hold so much milk!\n");
            while(1)printf("TAT~");
        }
        printf("Dad puts milk in fridge and leaves.\n");  
        // pthread_mutex_unlock(&fri_lock);
        sem_post(&sonlock);
    }
    
}

void *grandfather(int *num){
    
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
        sem_wait(&parent_lock);
        // pthread_mutex_lock(&fri_lock);
        printf("Grandfather comes home.\n");
        sleep(rand()%2+1);
        printf("Grandfather goes to buy milk.\n");
        *num += 1;
        if (*num > 2){
            printf("What a waste of food! The fridge can not hold so much milk!\n");
            while(1){
             printf("TAT~");
            }
        }
        printf("Grandfather puts milk in fridge and leaves.\n");
        // pthread_mutex_unlock(&fri_lock);
        sem_post(&sonlock);
    }
    
}

void *son(int *num){
    for(int i = 0; i < 30 ; i++){
        sem_wait(&sonlock);
        pthread_mutex_lock(&fri_lock);
        printf("Son comes home.\n");
        if(*num == 0){
            printf("The fridge is empty!\n");
            while(1){
             printf("TAT~");
            }
        }
        printf("Son fetches a milk\n");
        *num -= 1;
        printf("Son leaves\n");
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&fri_lock);
        sem_post(&parent_lock);
    }
    
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    srand(time(0));

    sem_init(&sonlock,0,0);
    sem_init(&parent_lock,0,2);

    int num_milk = 0;
    pthread_t p1, p2, p3, p4;
    pthread_mutex_init(&fri_lock,NULL);

    // Create two threads (both run func)  
    pthread_create(&p1, NULL, mom, &num_milk); 
    pthread_create(&p2, NULL, dad, &num_milk); 
    pthread_create(&p3, NULL, grandfather, &num_milk); 
    pthread_create(&p4, NULL, son, &num_milk); 
  
    // Wait for the threads to end. 
    pthread_join(p1, NULL); 
    pthread_join(p2, NULL); 
    pthread_join(p3, NULL); 
    pthread_join(p4, NULL); 

    printf("success!\n");
}
